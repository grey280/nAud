		<p>Software like this, once fully-functional, has several useful applications. The obvious is for <span class="mir">music information retrieval</span> purposes, where it could be quite useful for aiding researchers in annotating non-notated music.</p>
		<p>Looking away from MIR techniques, the same sort of algorithm could be combined with speech-recognition software to automatically annotate panel discussions or podcasts, making them much more accessible for hearing-impaired users, as well as more easily searchable.</p>
