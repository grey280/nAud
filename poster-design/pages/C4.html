	<p>The second application of <span class="neuralnet">neural networks</span> for <span class="mir">music information retrieval</span> we looked at was for identifying solos in examples of popular music and categorizing them.</p>
	<p>We used portions of the <a class="citation" target="_blank" href="http://medleydb.weebly.com">MedleyDB (R. Bittner, J. Salamon, M. Tierney, M. Mauch, C. Cannam and J. P. Bello)</a> for training - it's necessary to have good examples of each category, and the <span class="mir">song stems</span> that their database provides worked wonderfully.</p>
	<p>Based on the use of modern popular music, it was easy to find a small set of categories to use for sorting. Once again, we used <span class="instID">four categories</span>:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Vocal solo</li>
		<li>Guitar solo</li>
		<li>Drum solo</li>
		<li>Other (not a solo)</li>
	</ul>
