	<h1>Initial Series</h1>
	<div>
		<p>The first series of test were largely homogenous in how effective they were, hovering around 75-80% accuracy.</p>
		<p>Unfortunately, this level of accuracy, due to the biased nature of the sample set, is roughly what could be achieved by the neural network guessing 'popular' for every song in the dataset. This problem led to the creation of the limited series.</p>

	<h1>Limited Series</h1>
	<div>
		<p>The last nine tests (named "The120" and "The120Repeat") used a limited variant of the sample library, pulling 40 songs in each category at random and feeding them through in a variety of different manners.</p>
		<p>The highest accuracy achieved was 46.7%, but this is still better than the initial series- if it were guessing at random here, the success rate would be roughly 33%.</p>
