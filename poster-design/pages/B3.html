	<p>The first application of <span class="neuralnet">neural networks</span> for <span class="mir">music information retrieval</span> we looked at was for categorizing songs into different genres.</p>
	<p>Based on <a class="citation" href="http://www.iaeng.org/publication/IMECS2010/IMECS2010_pp546-550.pdf" target="_blank">"Automatic Musical Pattern Feature Extraction Using Convolutional Neural Network" (Li, T., Chan, A., Chun, A..)</a>, we wanted to split music into at most four categories.</p>
	<p>Following some brief attempts at coming up with our own categorizations, we opted to use Philip Tagg's axiomatic triangle, a system used by musicologists since the 1980s. This gives us <span class="genreID">three categories</span> into which all music can be sorted:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Art music</li>
		<li>Popular music</li>
		<li>Traditional music</li>
	</ul>
