<p>The use of <span class="neuralnet">deep neural networks</span> has exploded in popularity recently. Thinking that <span class="mir">music information retrieval</span> shouldn't be left out of this trend in machine learning, we explore two different applications of this technology in the field.</p>
<p>The first we looked at was <span class="genreID">genre identificaton</span>, using the initial categories of 'popular music,' 'art music,' and 'traditional music.' This was found to be a difficult problem - classifying music into these categories can be challenging even for experts, and assembling a large dataset for use in training represents a significant problem.</p>
<p>The second approach we took to using these techniques was looking at <span class="instID">instrument identification</span>, specifically for the purpose of identifying the time and category (from "guitar", "vocal", or "drum") of solos in popular music.</p>
