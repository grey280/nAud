	<h1>Data Set</h1>
	<div>
		<p>The data set was composed of samples from the <a class="citation" target="_blank" href="http://medleydb.weebly.com">MedleyDB (R. Bittner, J. Salamon, M. Tierney, M. Mauch, C. Cannam and J. P. Bello)</a>.</p>
		<p>For ease of processing, <a href="../data/instlib.json" class="citation" target="_blank" download>a small JSON file</a> was created with references to the file locations and their proper categorizations.</p>

	<h1>Training</h1>
	<div>
		<p>This <span class="neuralnet">neural network</span> took advantage of a more aggressive form of <span class="mir">windowing</span> than the last did.</p>
		<p>Rather than read in a single sample from each file, the software reads in the entire file, splitting it into overlapping windows of variable size. (We generally used 1-second windows, with a half-second of overlap in each direction for thorough coverage.)</p>
		<p>Once divided like this, and entire file can be fed in in sequential order, yielding a timeline of the entire song indicating where solos were occurring.</p>

	<h1>Analysis</h1>
	<div>
		<p>After feeding an entire file through the network, an array of <span class="neuralnet">softmax</span> results was created.</p>
		<p>For example: <span class="code">[[0.01, 0.02, 0.90, 0.07], [0.03, 0.02, 0.89, 0.0.6], ...]</span></p>
		<p>This was then fed through a function that converted it from a direct linear array into an array of ranges, formatted as:</p>
		<pre class="code">[{
       "start": 10,
       "stop": 15,
       "category": "vocal"
 }, ...]</pre>
 	<p>Formatted as such, this data is much more manageable.</p>
