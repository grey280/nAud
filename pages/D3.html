	<h1>Samples</h1>

		<p>The 'sample' series of tests, in which the <span class="neuralnet">network</span> was fed raw sample data, was tested with a variety of network layouts. Unfortunately, the highest accuracy achieved was only 45%.</p>

	<h1>Fourier Transform</h1>
	<div>
		<p>Feeding the network data that had been passed through a <span class="mir">Fast Fourier Transform</span> gave lower overall accuracy, but a single test that reported 47% accuracy. Further comparison between the two methods is recommended.</p>
