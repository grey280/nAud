	<h1>Assembling the Data Set</h1>
	<div>
		<p>Initially, our dataset was composed out of the iTunes library of a member of the research team. <a class="citation code" target="_blank" href="https://ffmpeg.org">ffmpeg</a> was used to convert files to the .wav format, as Python (using <span class="code">scipy.io.wavfile</span>) handles that audio format well.</p>
		<p>When this was found to be lacking in 'art' and 'traditional' music, steps were taken to expand the library in those directions, gathering open-domain recordings in both categories where available.</p>
		<p>The files were renamed to a standardized format (<span class="code">year.artist.album.title.wav</span>) and stored in a single location. A <a class="citation" target="_blank" download href="../data/library.plist">separate library file</a> was generated to hold additional metadata, where appropriate.</p>

	<h1>Training</h1>
	<div>
		<p>Training was performed using the full dataset, with somewhere between 10 and 25 percent of the data being held aside as <span class="neuralnet">validation data.</span></p>
		<p>Evaluation data saving was implemented later, with a similarly variable portion of the dataset being held aside for use as evaluation-only data. Both of these served to identify <span class="neuralnet" title="Overfitting is like memorizing the answers to a math test, rather than learning to do the problems.">overfitting</span> issues.</p>
		<p>Several varying <span class="mir">windows</span> were used:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The first 15 seconds of the song</li>
			<li>The 15 seconds of the song from 1:00 to 1:15</li>
			<li>15 seconds composed of 3 5-second clips, selected at random from within the song</li>
		</ul>

<section class="genreID">
	<h1>Analysis</h1>
	<div>
		<p>A variety of neural network structures were attempted, with the resulting models and weights stored and the training-reported accuracies logged.</p>
		<p>For some trials, we did an in-depth analysis, having the trained neural network run through the entire library, logging the 'correct' category and the <span class="neuralnet">softmax</span> result from the network. These were used to identify problems the network had.</p>
