<p>Overfitting proves to be a significant problem - the graph at right shows that identification of 'art' and 'tradition' failed nearly all of the time, when trained against a biased dataset.</p>

<p>Alleviating this by limiting the size of the sample set allows other trends to come to light. Most notable of these is a trend towards <span class="genreID">more accuracy when using randomized samples</span> from within the songs, as opposed to samples from a fixed point. Shuffling these samples while training, to create an increase in the amount of coverage of any given song, increased accuracy from 5-20 percentage points.</p>

<p>Even within the biased sample set, using these randomized samples increased accuracy, more than any change to the structure of the neural network did. Comparing the three windows mentioned above showed a minimum 5 percentage point increase in accuracy.</p>
