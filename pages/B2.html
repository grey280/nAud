	<p>The output of the <span class="neuralnet">neural network</span> can take a few different forms, depending on what you want.</p>
	<p>There is the <span class="neuralnet">categorization</span>, which will take an input and return the number of the category it is in: <span class="code">nn.evaluate([0, 821, 1643, 2461, 3278, 4092, 4901,...])</span> would return <span class="code">2</span>, where 2 is the category ID for 'art.'</p>
	<p>A <span class="neuralnet">softmax</span> layer will instead return the neural network's probabilities for <em>all</em> of the categories.</p>
	<p><span class="code">nn.evaluate([0, 821, 1643, 2461, 3278, 4092, 4901,...])</span> would return <span class="code">[0.05, 0.11, 0.75, 0.08]</span>. Both give the same information - it's probably category 2 - but with the softmax layer it is visible how sure of the decision the neural network is.</p>
	<p>Because of this additional information, we used softmax outputs throughout.</p>
